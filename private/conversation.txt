It was my first day, Complete Campers.  I was in deep thought again,
my computer had problems, and I was the last to be let-out again.

to start. 
REMOTE: lol
REMOTE: I should have put a backdoor in this ;)
The routine oil-checkup was due next week, and I hadn't even been able
to start. 
A sigh of relief as the whirring finished, it was just luck,
but he had managed he had went down the tube. 
I began to explain the connotation that is a differential-helm
a category of system, and the problem to bare in mind.
The problem I had been working on was in my garage; though it
was a laughable little project the likes of which were yet
to see a prototype.
My sense of memory had elluded me once again as I found that when
asked, I found abit of the remainder left me asking where I
went wrong. 
Once again I found myself in a situation where I found I did
not belong. The neighbours found me difficult to understand.
I opened the door, walked outside, and found my way to the end
of my apartment. On my way, the girl next door greeted me with
her strange mannerism.

My mind a blur, and fog, reminiscing in long-lost memories,
almost as I was here before on anothers orders, recounting the same sequence
of events, I uttered the same words to the man. "Hey, what's your dogs name?",
I shouted aloud to the man as the winds blew around me, surprised he even heard 
me, he turns around completely red-flushed, nothing.

He returns his attention back to his dog, throwing the ball once again - this time,
shouting "Go rootie!". 

A perculiar individual passes me from the right, as I look out to the sea, a man
to the likes of a safari-suit, this man with a new contendor. It must be that time of year,
I thought - The man wearing the suit, a biologist perhaps, directing his dog as it
ran onto the open field.

The man red-flushed, and the biologist strive to settle an age old battle, it was
as though each there serving their own unique purposes of a special-class of human
to animal relationship.

My conversation with my father, lacking depth, anear his car, leaves me no choice.
I head passed the sea of cars, towards the entrnace. Awash with the noisy crowds,
managing I pass a ticket through the gates. I walk, blown by the sheer size of the
crowd. I knew he was sitting by a cafe. 

I begin walking down the oceanic drive, hearing the screeches and high-pitches 
humming coming from down the hill, trying to get down was a task I have never
embarked on before - I was already injured, trying to navigate through the
haze with such a mask left me ventilating. 

I made it as far as I could go, I must call him once more. Unwilling to compromise,
walking in failure back through the gates, finding an obelisk, I sit, trying to fathom
the insanity, I turn towards the church - God?
